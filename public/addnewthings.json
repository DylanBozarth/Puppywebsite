      "testimonial": "I first met Juan and Michelle With JYMR Doodles in the Lehi Cabelas store a couple of years ago. They had the most beautiful standard poodle with them. His name is Cash. He stole my heart as well as their kindness and willingness to answer my questions. In speaking with Michelle I found out about JYMR DOODLES! I had been talking to my John about getting either a labradoodle or golden doodle. When I finally retired the following spring I contacted Michelle. What a great experience! They are very professional. I was impressed by her knowledge and integrity. I picked my pup, we named him Buck and soon went back and purchased another one so our boy would have a great playmate. We named him Roo, so that would be BUCK AND ROO (I used to call my twin boys my little BUCKAROOS).  Long story short JYMR makes it very easy to work with them and they have quality pups. The temperament of my boys is amazing. They want to please and are good listeners. I have had Queensland healers, golden retrievers, and a boarder collie. The Labradoodles are by far the smartest and easiest dogs I have ever had. I wanted my sister in California to have JOY these pups have given me and went back to JYMR and purchased a Minnie labradoodle for my sister. We both cried when we picked her up. Her name is Betsy and I FaceTime with her a couple of times a week with my dogs. If you are looking for a breeder that is there for you and will answer questions and assist you with information, I highly recommend JYMR DOODLES. My pups are very healthy and beautiful.",
