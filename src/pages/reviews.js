            Rosie is the best dog! She is really cute and cuddly! And she likes
            to lick a lot! Iâ€™m so grateful to have her. She is my best friend
            and the best dog I could ever have! Love her so much!

            I first met Juan and Michelle With JYMR Doodles in the Lehi Cabelas
            store a couple of years ago. They had the most beautiful standard
            poodle with them. His name is Cash. He stole my heart as well as
            their kindness and willingness to answer my questions. In speaking
            with Michelle I found out about JYMR DOODLES! I had been talking to
            my John about getting either a labradoodle or golden doodle. When I
            finally retired the following spring I contacted Michelle. What a
            great experience! They are very professional. I was impressed by her
            knowledge and integrity. I picked my pup, we named him Buck and soon
            went back and purchased another one so our boy would have a great
            playmate. We named him Roo, so that would be BUCK AND ROO (I used to
            call my twin boys my little BUCKAROOS).

           Long story short JYMR makes
            it very easy to work with them and they have quality pups. The
            temperament of my boys is amazing. They want to please and are good
            listeners. I have had Queensland healers, golden retrievers, and a
            boarder collie. The Labradoodles are by far the smartest and easiest
            dogs I have ever had. I wanted my sister in California to have JOY
            these pups have given me and went back to JYMR and purchased a
            Minnie labradoodle for my sister. We both cried when we picked her
            up. Her name is Betsy and I FaceTime with her a couple of times a
            week with my dogs. If you are looking for a breeder that is there
            for you and will answer questions and assist you with information, I
            highly recommend JYMR DOODLES. My pups are very healthy and
            beautiful.
